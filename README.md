## THIS IS A PREDICTIVE-ANALYSIS-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING ON A LARGE DATASET OF FLIGHTS.CSV FILE. NOW IN THIS I HAVE USED SOME MACHINE LEARNING MODELS LIKE CLASSIFICATION/REGRESSION TO PREDICT THE ACCURACY SCORE OF THE MODEL. THE TECHNIQUES I HAVE USED ARE TRAIN SPLIT MODEL WITH LOGISTIC REGRESSION AND LINEAR REGRESSION AND THE K-MEANS CLUSTERING MODEL TO PREDICT THE THE ACCURACY. I HAVE SOME VISUATIONS TOOLS TO GIVE A MORE CLEAR INSIGHTS USING SCATTER PLOT. THE MODEL PREDICTS THE MEAN SQUARED ERROR. THE MODEL GIVES PREDICTIONS ABOUT DELAYED FLIGHTS, ARRIVAL FLIGHTS ABOUT HOW MUCH IT IS LIKELY TO GOING TO HAPPEN. IT CAN PREDICT DISTANCES TOO ABOUT FLIGHTS USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUE ##
